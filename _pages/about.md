I'm a second year PhD student from [Civil Engineering Department](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/civileng/), StonyBrook University. My research interest includes sinkhole geohazards, CO<sub>2</sub> storage, enhanced gas/oil recovery, rock mechanics. My current research focuses on [Wormhole Formation](https://onepetro.org/ARMAUSRMS/proceedings/ARMA24/ARMA24/ARMA-2024-0068/548999) and Photoporomechanics.I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Wei Li at [Geosystems Engineering Lab](https://www.weili-geo.com/home), Stony Brook University.
