  <h1>Welcome to Zijie's Homepage!</h1>
</div>
I'm a second year PhD student from [Civil Engineering Department](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/civileng/), StonyBrook University. My research interest includes sinkhole geohazards, CO<sub>2</sub> storage, enhanced gas/oil recovery, rock mechanics, with a particular focus on [Wormhole Formation](https://onepetro.org/ARMAUSRMS/proceedings/ARMA24/ARMA24/ARMA-2024-0068/548999) and Photoporomechanics. Before joining SBU, I earned my Bachelor's degree from Fuzhou University and my Master's degree from Chongqing University. My current advisor is Prof. Wei Li at the [Geosystems Engineering Lab](https://www.weili-geo.com/home), Stony Brook University, a dynamic and creative team that I am very fortunate to be part of. 
<br>You can find my CV here: [Zijie's Curriculum Vitae](../_pages/Zijie%20Xu's%20CV.pdf).
