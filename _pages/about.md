I'm a second year PhD student from [Civil Engineering Department](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/civileng/), [StonyBrook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). My research interest includes sinkhole geohazards, CO<sub>2</sub> storage, enhanced gas/oil recovery. My current research focuses on [Wormhole Formation]([https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/civileng/](https://onepetro.org/ARMAUSRMS/proceedings/ARMA24/ARMA24/ARMA-2024-0068/548999) and Photoporomechanics.
I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Wei Li at [Geosystems Engineering Lab](https://www.weili-geo.com/home), Stony Brook University. 
You can find my CV here: [Zijie's Curriculum Vitae](Zijie Xu's CV.pdf).
