I'm a second year PhD student from [Civil Engineering Department](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/civileng/), [StonyBrook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). My research interest includes sinkhole geohazards, CO$_2$ storage, enhanced gas/oil recovery. My current research focus on [Wormhole Formation]([https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/civileng/](https://onepetro.org/ARMAUSRMS/proceedings/ARMA24/ARMA24/ARMA-2024-0068/548999)) and Photoporomechanics.
I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Wei Li at [Geosystems Engineering Lab](https://www.weili-geo.com/home), Stony Brook University.
