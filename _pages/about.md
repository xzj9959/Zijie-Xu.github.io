I'm a second year PhD student from [Civil Engineering Department](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/civileng/), [StonyBrook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). My research interest includes computer vision, computergraphics, machine learning, and computational photography.
I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Wei Li of Geosystems Engineering Lab at Stony Brook University.
